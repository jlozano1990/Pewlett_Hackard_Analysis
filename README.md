# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees as well as their title within the company and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
## Results
- Based off our analysis of the number of employees that will be eligible for retirement soon, we can see there a lot of positions that will be left vacant and will need to be filled. In our employees.csv sheet, we can see there are about 300,000 unique employees. By running our analysis, we see there are about 40,000 employees who will be eligible for retirement soon. That's about a fifth of the company!

- The majority of employees that will be retiring are senior staff, so obviously, they will be leaving behind some big shoes to fill. Senior staff typically have more responsibilities to deal with, so it will be a big loss if they retire and no one is able to take on their responsibilities. A lot of the employees eligible for retirement have multiple roles and titles.

- One solution for this problem would be to prepare employees who will still be working at the company and are of a certain age to take on more of those responsibilities. If we look at employees who were born in the year 1965, we see we have about 1550 employees who fit that requirement.

## Summary
From our analysis, we can see that the employees who will be retiring soon hold about 90,000 unique positions that need to be filled. If we only take into account employees who were born in the year 1965 for the mentorship program, we'll only have about 1,500 eligible employees. We should take into other employees even if they have earlier or later birth dates in order to fill the holes left tby the high amount of retiring employees. If we shift our requirement to include employees born in the year 1984, there are close to 20,000 results, which would help fill those gaps left by retiring employees.
